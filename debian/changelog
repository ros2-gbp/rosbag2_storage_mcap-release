ros-galactic-rosbag2-storage-mcap (0.1.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * [1.0.0] Use Summary section for get_metadata() and seek(), implement remaining methods (#17 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/17>)
  * feat: add play impl (#16 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/16>)
  * chore: refine package.xml (#15 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/15>)
  * Don't throw when READ_WRITE mode is used; add .mcap file extension to recorded files (#14 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/14>)
    I may be missing something, but from a cursory glance at [this code](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/342d8ed3c1c4ae0411a4a92b60e79a728b8974b8/rosbag2_storage/src/rosbag2_storage/impl/storage_factory_impl.hpp#L108-L135), it appears that the APPEND mode is never used. This means we need to support READ_WRITE.
    This also adds a .mcap extension to recorded file names.
  * Add dynamic message definition lookup (#13 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/13>)
    Currently, an exception will be thrown if lookup fails.
  * Switch C++ formatter to clang-format (#12 <https://github.com/wep21/rosbag2_storage_mcap/issues/12>)
    Remove uncrustify linter in favor of clang-format, which is easier to configure for use in VS Code format-on-save.
